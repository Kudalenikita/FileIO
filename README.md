# FileIO
This is a simple console-based Notes Manager application developed in Java. It allows users to write personal notes and read all previously saved notes. The application uses Java File I/O (FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader) to persist notes in a local file (notes.txt). 

 Java Notes Manager (File I/O Based)

 Description
A simple text-based Notes App built using Java. It allows users to write and read notes using file operations. Notes are saved to a local text file (`notes.txt`) and persist even after the program is closed.

 Objective
- Practice Java File I/O using `FileWriter`, `FileReader`, and `BufferedReader`.
- Understand how to persist user data (notes) in a local file.
- Build a basic console-based note-taking system.

 Tools & Technologies
- Java (JDK)
- VS Code / IntelliJ
- Terminal / Command Prompt
- FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader

 How to Run
1. Open the project folder in VS Code or any Java IDE.
2. Compile the Java file using:
3. Run the program using:
4. Use the on-screen menu to:
- Add a new note
- Read existing notes
- Exit the program

Features
-  Write new notes and save to a file
-  Read all saved notes from the file
-  Data is stored in `notes.txt` file and persists after closing the program

 Learning Outcome
- Understand how to use Java File I/O (read/write)
- Learn how to handle user input and file-based data persistence
- Gain experience with exception handling in Java

Output File
- `notes.txt`: This file will be created automatically in the project directory to store notes.
